This course will give you practical skills of doing Continuous Integration (CI) in a GitHub-based repository.  

You learned Git commands but sometimes not sure how real-world Continuous Integration is done? Or maybe you already doing it but want to understand the theory better to fine-tune your everyday actions? This course will help. During the course, you'll practice common continuous integration actions. It isn't intended to be a click-through wizard-style experience, instead you'll do what developers do during their daily work the way they do it. I'll explain the theory as you reach relevant steps.

## What you'll do

You'll go through these common CI scenarios:
- Working on a feature;
- Using auto tests to ensure quality;
- Implementing a bugfix;
- Resolving merge conflicts;
- Dealing with a bug in production.

## What you'll learn

You'll be able to answer the questions:
- What is Continuous Integration, really?
- What types of auto tests are used with CI and when they are triggered?
- What are pull requests and when you need them?
- What is Test Driven Development and how it relates to CI?
- To merge or to rebase?
- To roll back or to fix forward?
